Create a text file named transactions.txt and use the template format to add rows of transaction details. Git will ignore transactions.txt so you can keep it local.
Add the following to .bash_profile (on Mac) if you want to access calculator everywhere
```sh
alias profit='python ~/calculator/profit.py'
```
